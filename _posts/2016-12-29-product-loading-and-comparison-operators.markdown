# Issue Tracker

Started using the GitHub issue tracking feature. This is new to me, so I am hoping that over time this becomes more natural to use. So far it seems to work well for what I want to use it for.

# IDataLoad Product

I have finished the product loading of information and found that not all data was handled properly. So I have created an issue for that. After finishing the loading of the code, I have updated the testing UI to just ask for the Product information, and loading the extra data with it. I have also updated the code to allow for hiding of the IData usage (unless accessing the data). This should also be changed, and I will create a new issue to address this (just realized it as writting this blog post).

# Comparison Operator Adjustments

I have added all the overloads for all models that I want to be able to compair. There is still an issue with the internal workings of the compairson, where the data itself is different. I believe I will let this go for now, but have created an issue within GitHub to address this in the future.

# Future Updates

Still need to update the Wiki, but progress has been coming great!
