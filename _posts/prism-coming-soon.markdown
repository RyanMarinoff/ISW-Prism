### New Workings

I am at the point where the implementation of Prism is here. After doing a little research on the subject, I have found that Microsoft is not supporting Prism directly, but has handed it over to the community. This is the new initiative of Microsoft with their core developer technologies. With this, I have found that Prism is now in version 6.2, with development of 6.3 in the works. I will stay with the stable release for now. There are a few sources that I will utilize to gain an understanding of Prism and how to implement the technologies. I believe I know enough of MVVM to follow the terminologies and structural mindset of Prism for WPF. This may or may not be done off premises, it is currently unknown.
