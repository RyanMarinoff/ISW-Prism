# Wiki

This update is going to be smaller. Work took over more of the day than development, and the updates listed here were a bit more time consuming than previously guessed. I have updated the Wiki to include the new data within the application. This update is currently not complete. I have also changed a little formatting of that wiki. Test code is not being placed into the wiki for it is not going to stay within the application. I have added comments to areas that need additional commenting, including pointing out temporary test code.

# Code Edit

During the updating of the wiki and commenting the code, I have noticed that there are a few changes needed within the base of the code. To avoid errors in the future, I have implemented some of the changes that came to light. This includes the addition of an OptionCategory model, which are the categories of the options that can be assigned to each. I have re-ordered a few bits of code within the IDataLoader, nothing that changes functionality. I have added the OptionCategory loader within the IDataLoader.

# End of Day

Next work is to complete Wiki updates and application commenting. Code clean-up and testing will also be done.
