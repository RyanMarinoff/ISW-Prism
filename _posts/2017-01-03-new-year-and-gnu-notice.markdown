### Happy New Year

Wishing everyone who reads the blog a happy new year! Hope all your hard work, planning, and dreams brings great success!

### GNU Notice

I have added a GNU notice to all code files of the project.

### End of Day

There wasn't much work done today. An update to the blog was made yesterday for last year, and today was filled with the rest of the end of the year issues. Continuation of previous issues into the future.
