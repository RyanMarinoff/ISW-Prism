# ISW-Prism
This will be my prism implementation of the Internet Sales Work application. See the Wiki for technical information.

The application will be developed using the recent version of Visual Studio Community Edition. The project is for me, to make my job easier to do when I wish to maintain data within the internet database. The final outcome of the project is to setup a 'slick' user interface that would be easily used and pleasing to the eye.

## Compile Code
To use ISW-Prism, download the code and open the solution within Visual Studio 2015 or later. Compile and run. Currently there is no working UI for the application.
